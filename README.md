**DEFIscape** is a non-custodial web interface that helps users reclaim assets stuck in abandoned or deprecated DeFi protocols.  
When UIs vanish, teams disappear, or hosting is shut down, staking contracts and LP vaults remain on-chain — but become inaccessible.  
**DEFIscape restores one-click access — directly from your wallet.**

**DEFIscape restores access to these assets safely and transparently.**

---

## 🚨 The Problem

Across EVM ecosystems, **$2–4 billion in user capital is technically recoverable — but effectively lost**.  
Not from hacks. From vanished UIs and missing interfaces.
<i>(Estimate based on DeFiLlama’s “Inactive Protocols” ($2.1B+ TVL) and EigenPhi’s “Zombie Liquidity” research (2024).)</i>

Users are stuck in two types of positions:  
→ **Legacy positions in active protocols** (Uniswap v2, Pancake v2, Sushi legacy, Yearn v1, Aave v1/v2, Venus, GMX v1)  
→ **Fully abandoned projects** (Wault, Retro, Polycat, LooksRare rewards, Bancor v2 +300 others)

Result: hundreds of millions sit frozen while users believe their money is gone forever.  
**Your funds aren’t lost — they are simply inaccessible without a proper interface.**

---

## ✅ The Solution

**DEFIscape is a 100% non-custodial recovery layer** that brings back access — with zero trust required.

- **One-click unstake** from any protocol — even if the UI is gone  
- **Direct wallet → contract calls** — no custom contracts, no approvals, zero audit risk  
- **Live on 19 EVM chains**: Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, BSC, Base, zkSync Era, Scroll, Linea + 11 more  
- **40+ protocols supported today** → 400+ planned in 6 months  
- **Mobile-ready + WalletConnect v2**

> You stay in full control. We just bring back the buttons that disappeared.
